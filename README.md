## Cinementality
 
A site to search for triggers in movies for those with mental health issues. 

# Motivation

As a person with mental health struggles I want to be able to look up movies by triggers I might like to avoid, and find out if they offer any level of catharsis. When I search for a movie in the database, I want it to return a result with the movie title, catharsis rating, trigger rating, and list of potential triggers.
