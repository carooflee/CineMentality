## CineMentality
 
A site to search for triggers in movies for those with mental health issues. 

# Motivation

As a person with mental health struggles I want to be able to look up movies by triggers I might like to avoid, and find out if they offer any level of catharsis. When I search for a movie in the database, I want it to return a result with the movie title, catharsis rating, trigger rating, and list of potential triggers.  
    
# Installation
  `npm install express`
  
  `npm install express-handlebars`
  
  `npm install sequelize`
  
  `npm install bcryptjs`
  
  `node server.js`
  
  `npm install dotenv`
  
Then launch from localhost:9000 in the browser

# Testing
We used Travis CI. To get started you'll need to do the following.

1. Accept the Authorization of Travis CI. Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHub.
1. Click on your profile picture in the top right of your Travis Dashboard, click Settings and then the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.
